            <h4>Yes, I know some programming, but I want that degree</h4>
            <p>I want to preface this stating that I have spent time in a coding Bootcamp in Seattle. I spent 1 month learning front end web dev with vanilla HTML, CSS, & JS. Then I spent a month learning backend programing in JS using Node, Heroku, and Jquery. After those two months, I went through their final course for full stack Java Development and that was 3 months long which was split into 2 parts. The first half was learning the language and using SpringMVC Framkework to create fullstack projects and the second half was using Android Studio to create APK's. With that said and out of the way I am a bit rusty and am looking to brush up on my skills as well as earn a degree.</p>
