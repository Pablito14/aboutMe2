            <h4>Some Background</h4>
            <p>I want to preface this stating that I have spent time in a coding Bootcamp in Seattle. I spent 1 month learning front end web dev with vanilla HTML, CSS, & JS. Then I spent a month learning backend programing in JS using Node, Heroku, Postgresql, and Jquery. After those two months, I went through their final course for full stack Java Development and that was 3 months long which was split into 2 parts. The first half was learning the language and using SpringMVC Framkework to create fullstack projects and the second half was using Android Studio to create APK's. With that said and out of the way I am a bit rusty and am looking to brush up on my skills as well as earn a degree. Through out the entire five months there I was using WSL to familiarize myself with Linux Command Line tools that are commonly used in the iundustry. I Have used git as my Version Control System and I </p>

            <h4>So Who am I again?</h4>
            <p>Hi, my name is Pablo Rosales & I am a Software Developer born and raised in the greater Seattle Area. I come from the service industry, construction, as well as manufacturing. Throughout my time as a server, I learned how to talk to my customers to find their needs and keep my client happy. I also learned the importance of communicating with your team to work well together and create a safe work environment. I want to be a developer because I have always had an interest in tech, and I want to be more involved in that community, and do things that are more useful than making coffee, pancakes, wood shavings, or cleaning up a construction site.
            I want to use my skills as a developer to bring tech more to the front of low-income, and non-English speaking communities. I want tech to be something that is accessible to everyone to use as a productive tool and hopefully fun experience. My goal is to share what I learn, both the successful approaches to this as well as the failures I encounter along the way. I want to continue growing as a developer along the way and create a more inclusive community.</p>
